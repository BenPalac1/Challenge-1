# Module 1 Challenge

Code Refactor, Accessibility Challenge Submission

This repository contains my solution for the Module 1 Challenge:


  I changed HTML elements to semantic HTML elements so they're easier to navigate.

  The elements follow a logical structure.

  Added accessible alt attributes to the image elements that give a brief description of what each image is.

  Heading attributes fall in sequential order.

  Title element is a concise, descriptive title.
