# Module 1 Challenge

Code Refactor, Accessibility Challenge Submission

This repository contains my solution for the Module 1 Challenge:

I changed HTML elements to semantic HTML elements.
The elements follow a logical structure.
Added accessible alt attributes to the image elements.
Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
Title element is a concise, descriptive title.
